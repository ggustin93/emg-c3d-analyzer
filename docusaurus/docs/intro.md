# Ghostly+ Dashboard Documentation

The Ghostly+ Dashboard is a clinical research platform for processing and analyzing electromyography data from GHOSTLY rehabilitation game sessions. Built with React, FastAPI, and Supabase, it provides therapists with automated signal analysis, contraction detection, and performance metrics to track patient progress. This documentation covers the system architecture, implementation details, and deployment procedures for developers and system administrators.
