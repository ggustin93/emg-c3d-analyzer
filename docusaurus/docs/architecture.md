# GHOSTLY+ Dashboard - Architecture

## Overview

The GHOSTLY+ system transforms electromyography data from rehabilitation therapy sessions into clinical insights. This document provides an architectural overview of how React, FastAPI, and Supabase work together to process EMG signals and help therapists track patient progress.

**Quick Navigation:**
- **Backend Development** â†’ [Backend Architecture](./backend.md)
- **Frontend Development** â†’ [Frontend Overview](./frontend/overview.md)
- **DevOps & Deployment** â†’ [DevOps Guide](./devops/devops.md)

## Technology Stack

The system combines modern frameworks selected for reliability and developer experience:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React 19 + TypeScript | Type-safe component development with modern hooks |
| **Backend** | FastAPI + Python 3.10 | High-performance API with automatic documentation |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL via Supabase | Structured data with Row Level Security |
| **Storage** | Supabase Storage | C3D file storage with webhook triggers |
| **Cache** | Redis 7.2 | Session caching and performance optimization |
| **Deployment** | Coolify + Docker | Self-hosted platform with SSL and monitoring |

> **Note**: When deploying with Coolify, the built-in Traefik proxy handles SSL/TLS termination, domain routing, and load balancing automatically - no separate NGINX required.

## User Roles & System Architecture

The system supports **4 user types** with role-based access control:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', marginBottom: '2rem'}}>
  <img src="/emg-c3d-analyzer/img/user_roles.png" alt="User Roles and System Architecture" style={{maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', borderRadius: '8px', boxShadow: '0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'}} />
</div>

- **Patients** share C3D and BFR data through rehabilitation games
- **Therapists** monitor patient progress with access restricted to assigned patients  
- **Researchers** request analysis data with pseudonymized access only
- **Administrators** manage users and system configuration

The central back-end handles authentication, data capture, secure storage, and signal processing.

## System Architecture

The GHOSTLY+ system uses a 6-layer architecture with three API integration approaches:

## API Integration Architecture

The GHOSTLY+ system uses three complementary integration patterns optimized for medical data processing and rehabilitation workflows. Each approach serves distinct operational requirements while maintaining security through Supabase's Row Level Security.

    style Direct fill:#e8f5e9
    style Backend fill:#e3f2fd
    style API fill:#fff3e0
```

### Integration Patterns

| Approach | Route | Authentication | Use Cases |
|----------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Frontend Direct** | React â†’ Supabase | User JWT + RLS | Patient lists, clinical notes, file uploads |
| **Backend Direct** | Python â†’ Supabase | Service key / JWT | Admin operations, complex workflows |
| **API Pipeline** | React â†’ FastAPI â†’ Supabase | JWT validation | EMG processing, business logic |

## Key System Files

The most important files to understand the system's architecture:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `therapy_session_processor.py` | Core orchestration engine - coordinates entire workflow |
| `processor.py` | EMG signal processing - single source of truth for analysis |
| `performance_scoring_service.py` | Clinical scoring algorithms and metrics calculation |
| `emg_analysis.py` | Scientific EMG algorithms and clinical metrics |
| `signal_processing.py` | Low-level signal operations and filtering |
| `upload.py` | Stateless C3D processing endpoint for direct analysis |
| `webhooks.py` | Event-driven processing for Supabase storage events |
| `AppContent.tsx` | Main router with role-based access control |
| `TherapistOverview.tsx` | Primary clinical dashboard interface for patient monitoring |
| `AdminDashboard.tsx` | System administration and user management interface |
| `C3DFileBrowser.tsx` | File navigation and selection hub |
| `GameSessionTabs.tsx` | Multi-tab session analysis interface |
| `useAuth.ts` | Central authentication orchestrator |

## Processing Modes

The system supports two processing modes sharing the same core engine:

### Stateless Mode (Direct Upload)

Immediate, synchronous processing without persistence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Processor
    
    Client->>API: Upload C3D
    API->>Processor: Process file
    Processor-->>API: Analysis results
    API-->>Client: JSON response
```

**Use Cases**: Quick assessments, testing, development

### Stateful Mode (Webhook)

Asynchronous, event-driven processing with full persistence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Storage
    participant Webhook
    participant Session
    participant Database
    
    Storage->>Webhook: File uploaded
    Webhook->>Session: Create session
    Session->>Database: Save results
```

**Use Cases**: Clinical workflow, patient tracking, performance history


## Key Architectural Patterns

### Domain-Driven Design

Services organized by business domain:
```
backend/services/
â”œâ”€â”€ clinical/          # Therapy sessions, patient management
â”œâ”€â”€ c3d/              # C3D file processing
â”œâ”€â”€ analysis/         # EMG analysis coordination
â”œâ”€â”€ user/             # User management
â””â”€â”€ shared/           # Common utilities
```

### Repository Pattern

Clean separation between business logic and data access:
```python
class TherapySessionRepository:
    def create(self, session_data: dict) -> dict
    def get_by_id(self, session_id: str) -> dict
    def update(self, session_id: str, updates: dict) -> dict
```

### Dependency Injection

Services receive dependencies through constructors:
```python
class TherapySessionProcessor:
    def __init__(self, 
                 supabase_client: Client,
                 c3d_processor: GHOSTLYC3DProcessor,
                 scoring_service: PerformanceScoringService)
```

### Event-Driven Processing

Webhook endpoints enable background processing without blocking user interactions.

## Summary

The GHOSTLY+ system uses a 6-layer architecture with three API integration approaches that separate concerns across presentation, API gateway, application orchestration, domain logic, infrastructure services, and persistence. The key architectural decision is choosing between direct Supabase access, backend Supabase operations, and FastAPI processing based on complexity and requirements.
