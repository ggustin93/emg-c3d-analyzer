# Complete Coolify Installation Guide

## Summary

This guide documents the complete installation process for Coolify on VUB's Debian VM infrastructure, including solutions to critical challenges encountered during deployment.

### Key Challenges Solved ‚úÖ
1. **Storage Constraints**: Relocated Docker from `/var` (919MB) to `/opt` (65GB available)
2. **Service Dependencies**: Added PostgreSQL health checks to prevent startup failures
3. **Network Access**: Implemented SSH tunnel for secure web interface access
4. **Configuration Issues**: Fixed Docker Compose, encryption keys, and port mappings

### Quick Overview
- **Total Installation Time**: ~2 hours (including troubleshooting)
- **Success Rate**: 100% after implementing solutions below
- **Result**: Production-ready Coolify instance with full functionality

## Initial Context
- **System**: VUB Debian VM with undersized LVM partitions
- **Main Issue**: Insufficient disk space for Docker operations  
- **Architecture**: Separate partitions with `/var` limited to 919MB
- **Access**: SSH connection using private key authentication

## Prerequisites and Server Access

### Connecting to the VUB Server
```bash
# Connect to the Debian server using SSH key authentication
ssh -i ggustin_ghostly.pk ggustin@10.67.0.12
```

**Connection Details:**
- **Private Key**: `ggustin_ghostly.pk` (VUB-provided SSH key)
- **Username**: `ggustin` (non-root user account)  
- **Server IP**: `10.67.0.12` (VUB internal network)
- **OS**: Debian GNU/Linux with kernel 6.12.41

## Installation Steps and Problem Resolution

### Step 1: Initial Installation Attempt (Failed)
```bash
# Switch to root user for system-wide installation
sudo su -

# Attempt official Coolify installation
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

**Result**: Installation failed with "no space left on device" error during Docker image downloads.

**Root Cause**: Docker stores all its data in `/var/lib/docker` by default, but the `/var` partition was too small.

### Step 2: Disk Space Analysis
```bash
# Analyze current disk usage
df -h

# Check Docker directory size
du -sh /var/lib/docker 2>/dev/null || echo "Docker not yet installed"
```

**Findings**:
- `/var` partition: 919MB total (80% used) - **Too small for Docker**
- Root `/` partition: 69GB total (3% used) - **Plenty of space available**
- Docker requires several GB for images and containers

**Technical Explanation**: 
The VUB VM was configured with separate LVM partitions, which is good for security but problematic when one partition becomes too small. Docker's default location (`/var/lib/docker`) was on the constrained partition.

### Step 3: Critical Solution - Docker Relocation

<details>
<summary><strong>üîß Technical Implementation: Docker Storage Relocation</strong></summary>

```bash
# Arr√™t des services Docker
systemctl stop docker
systemctl stop containerd

# Cr√©ation du nouveau r√©pertoire sur la partition principale
mkdir -p /opt/docker-data

# D√©placement des donn√©es Docker existantes
mv /var/lib/docker /opt/docker-data/

# Cr√©ation du lien symbolique pour rediriger Docker
ln -s /opt/docker-data/docker /var/lib/docker

# Red√©marrage des services
systemctl start containerd
systemctl start docker

# V√©rification
docker info
```

**Why This Works**: This solution uses symbolic links to redirect Docker's data directory from the constrained `/var` partition (919MB) to the main partition with 65GB available space, while maintaining full compatibility with Docker's expected file paths.
</details>

### Step 4: Docker User Permissions Setup
```bash
# Add the current user to the docker group for non-root access
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Apply group changes without logging out
newgrp docker

# Test Docker permissions
docker ps
```

**Why This Matters**: By default, Docker requires root privileges. Adding the user to the docker group allows normal operation without sudo, which is essential for Coolify's functionality.

### Step 5: Fixing Corrupted Docker Compose Configuration

<details>
<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Problem & Solution: Complete Docker Compose Configuration</strong></summary>

**Problem**: The official Coolify docker-compose.yml file was incomplete, missing essential Docker image definitions for PostgreSQL, Redis, and Soketi services.

**Technical Issue**: Services defined without `image:` specifications cannot start, causing the classic "has neither an image nor a build context specified" error.

**Solution**: Replace with a complete, working configuration:

```bash
# Remplacement du fichier par une version compl√®te
cat > docker-compose.yml << 'EOF'
services:
  coolify:
    image: ghcr.io/coollabsio/coolify:4.0.0-beta.428
    container_name: coolify
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${APP_PORT:-8000}:8080"
    environment:

      - REDIS_PORT=6379
    volumes:
      - /data/coolify/ssh:/var/www/html/storage/app/ssh
      - /data/coolify/applications:/var/www/html/storage/app/applications
      - /data/coolify/databases:/var/www/html/storage/app/databases

      - /data/coolify/ssl:/var/www/html/storage/app/ssl
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - type: bind
        source: /data/coolify/source/.env
        target: /var/www/html/.env
        read_only: true
    networks:
      - coolify
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
      redis:
        condition: service_started
      soketi:
        condition: service_started

  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    container_name: coolify-db
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: coolify
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: coolify123
      POSTGRES_DB: coolify
    volumes:
      - coolify-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - coolify
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U coolify -d coolify"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: coolify-redis
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: redis-server --save 20 1 --loglevel warning --requirepass redis123
    environment:
      REDIS_PASSWORD: redis123
    volumes:
      - coolify-redis:/data
    networks:
      - coolify

  soketi:
    image: ghcr.io/coollabsio/coolify-realtime:1.0.10
    container_name: coolify-realtime
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "6001:6001"
      - "6002:6002"
    environment:
      APP_NAME: Coolify
      SOKETI_DEFAULT_APP_ID: coolify
      SOKETI_DEFAULT_APP_KEY: coolify-key  
      SOKETI_DEFAULT_APP_SECRET: coolify-secret
    volumes:
      - /data/coolify/ssh:/var/www/html/storage/app/ssh
    networks:
      - coolify

volumes:
  coolify-db:
  coolify-redis:

networks:
  coolify:
    name: coolify
    external: false
EOF
```
</details>

### Step 6: Implementing PostgreSQL Health Checks
**Problem**: Container orchestration timing issue - Coolify was attempting to start before PostgreSQL was ready, causing database migration failures.

**Technical Explanation**: In distributed systems, services start asynchronously. Without proper health checks, dependent services can fail when they try to connect to services that aren't fully initialized yet.

**Solution**: The docker-compose.yml above includes a PostgreSQL health check that ensures database readiness:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U coolify -d coolify"]
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 10
```

This prevents Coolify from starting until PostgreSQL can accept connections, eliminating race conditions.

### Step 7: Fixing Application Encryption Keys

<details>
<summary><strong>üîê Security Fix: Laravel Application Key Generation</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Laravel/Coolify requires a valid APP_KEY for encryption, but the generated key was malformed, causing "Unsupported cipher" errors.

```bash
# Remove any existing malformed key
sed -i '/APP_KEY=/d' .env

# Generate a proper base64-encoded 32-byte key
echo "APP_KEY=base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
```

**Why This Matters**: Laravel uses this key for:
- Session encryption
- Database field encryption  
- CSRF token generation
- Cookie security
</details>

### Step 8: Port Mapping Configuration Fix

<details>
<summary><strong>üåê Network Fix: Docker Port Mapping Correction</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Docker port mapping mismatch - the compose file mapped host port 8000 to container port 80, but Nginx inside the container actually listens on port 8080.

**Diagnosis Process**:
```bash
# Check what ports Nginx is actually using inside the container
docker exec coolify netstat -tlnp | grep nginx

# Result showed: tcp 0.0.0.0:8080 (not port 80)
```

**Solution**: Correct the port mapping in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
ports:
  - "${APP_PORT:-8000}:8080"  # Fixed: was :80, should be :8080
```
</details>

### Step 9: Clean Database Initialization
**Problem**: Previous failed attempts left corrupted database states and incomplete migrations.

```bash
# Stop all services and remove corrupted volumes
docker compose down -v

# Explicitly remove any lingering volumes
docker volume rm source_coolify-db source_coolify-redis 2>/dev/null || true

# Start with completely fresh database
docker compose up -d

# Monitor the initialization process
docker compose logs -f coolify
```

**Results**: All database migrations executed successfully, creating a clean Coolify instance.

### Step 10: Network Access Solution
**Problem**: Web interface showed blank pages when accessed via direct IP (10.67.0.12:8000), despite successful HTTP responses from curl.

**Root Cause**: Network security restrictions or firewall rules blocking external CSS/JavaScript asset loading.

**Solution**: SSH tunnel to bypass network restrictions:
```bash
# From your local machine, create an SSH tunnel
ssh -i ggustin_ghostly.pk -L 8000:localhost:8000 ggustin@10.67.0.12

# Access via localhost in your browser
# http://localhost:8000/register
```

**Technical Explanation**: The SSH tunnel encrypts all traffic and routes it through the established SSH connection, bypassing any intermediate network restrictions that might block asset loading.

## Final Working Architecture

### Service Configuration
- **Coolify Web Interface**: Accessible on port 8000 (external) ‚Üí 8080 (internal container)
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Port 5432 with health checks ensuring proper startup sequence
- **Redis Cache**: Port 6379 for session management and job queues
- **Soketi WebSocket Server**: Ports 6001-6002 for real-time application updates

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Docker Data**: Relocated to `/opt/docker-data` with 65GB available space
- **Persistent Volumes**: Dedicated Docker volumes for database and application data
- **Configuration Mapping**: Host directories mapped to container paths for persistent settings

### Network Access
- **Primary Access**: SSH tunnel for secure, reliable connection
- **Internal Communication**: Docker network isolates services while enabling inter-container communication
- **External Exposure**: Only necessary ports exposed to host system

## Verification and Maintenance Commands

### Installation Verification
```bash
# Check disk space utilization after Docker relocation
df -h

# Verify all containers are running
docker ps

# Check port mappings are correct
docker port coolify

# Test local connectivity
curl -I http://localhost:8000

# Review application logs
docker compose logs coolify

# Verify database migrations completed
docker exec coolify-db psql -U coolify -d coolify -c "\dt"
```

### Ongoing Maintenance
```bash
# Restart services if needed
docker compose restart

# Update Coolify (backup recommended first)
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d

# Clean up unused Docker resources
docker system prune -f

# Monitor disk usage
du -sh /opt/docker-data/
```

### Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
# Check Docker daemon status
systemctl status docker

# View container logs
docker compose logs [service_name]

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart [service_name]

# Check container resource usage
docker stats

# Verify network connectivity between containers
docker exec coolify ping coolify-db
```

## Critical Success Factors

### Root Cause Analysis
The installation succeeded because we addressed these fundamental issues:

1. **Storage Constraints**: LVM partition sizing is critical for Docker workloads
   - **Impact**: Without adequate space, container downloads and operations fail
   - **Solution**: Strategic relocation using symbolic links

2. **Service Dependencies**: Modern applications require careful orchestration
   - **Impact**: Services starting out of order cause cascading failures  
   - **Solution**: Health checks and dependency declarations

3. **Network Security**: Academic/corporate networks often have restrictions
   - **Impact**: External asset loading can fail, causing UI issues
   - **Solution**: SSH tunneling provides secure, reliable access

4. **Configuration Accuracy**: Container applications require precise setup
   - **Impact**: Port mismatches, missing images, or invalid keys cause failures
   - **Solution**: Systematic verification and correction of all configuration elements

### Best Practices Learned
- Always verify disk space before Docker installations
