# Automated C3D Processing Implementation Task

## Overview
Implement automated C3D file processing using Supabase Storage webhooks to trigger real-time EMG analysis when files are uploaded from the GHOSTLY mobile application.

## Status: üöß In Progress
Branch: `feature/automated-c3d-processing`
Created: 2025-08-11

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Setup ‚è≥
- [ ] Create C3D metadata table (stores file metadata, patient ID, session info)
- [ ] Create analysis results cache table (stores processed EMG analytics)
- [ ] Add performance indexes for quick lookups
- [ ] Test database migrations

### Phase 2: Webhook Endpoint Implementation üöÄ
- [ ] Create `/api/webhooks/storage/c3d-upload` endpoint
- [ ] Implement webhook signature verification
- [ ] Add request validation (event type, bucket, file extension)
- [ ] Test webhook with mock Supabase events

### Phase 3: C3D Metadata Extraction Service üìä
- [ ] Extract file metadata from C3D headers
- [ ] Store metadata in database
- [ ] Link metadata to storage path
- [ ] Test metadata extraction with sample files

### Phase 4: Analysis Caching System üíæ
- [ ] Implement cache check for existing analysis
- [ ] Store analysis results after processing
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategy
- [ ] Test cache hit/miss scenarios

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization ‚ö°
- [ ] Configure database connection pooling
- [ ] Implement async processing queue
- [ ] Add Redis caching layer (optional)
- [ ] Performance testing with concurrent uploads

### Phase 6: Testing Strategy üß™
- [ ] Unit tests for webhook validation
- [ ] Unit tests for metadata extraction
- [ ] Integration tests for full webhook flow
- [ ] Error recovery tests

### Phase 7: Documentation & Deployment üìö
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create deployment instructions
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Document Supabase configuration

### Phase 8: Supabase Configuration üîß
- [ ] Configure Storage webhook in dashboard
- [ ] Set up RLS policies
- [ ] Configure Edge Functions (optional)
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow

## Key Files to Create/Modify

### Backend Files
- `backend/api/webhooks.py` - New webhook endpoint handlers
- `backend/services/webhook_service.py` - Webhook verification and processing
- `backend/services/metadata_service.py` - C3D metadata extraction
- `backend/services/cache_service.py` - Analysis result caching
- `backend/models/database_models.py` - SQLAlchemy/Pydantic models for DB tables

### Database Migrations
- `migrations/001_create_c3d_metadata.sql`
- `migrations/002_create_analysis_cache.sql`
- `migrations/003_add_indexes.sql`

### Tests
- `backend/tests/test_webhooks.py`
- `backend/tests/test_metadata_service.py`
- `backend/tests/test_cache_service.py`

## MCP Server Integration
- **SERENA MCP**: For intelligent code navigation and implementation
- **SUPABASE MCP**: For database operations and storage management
- **CONTEXT7 MCP**: For documentation on Supabase webhooks and best practices

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Webhook receives and processes events < 1 second
- [ ] C3D metadata extraction completes < 2 seconds
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80% for repeated files
- [ ] Zero data loss with retry mechanisms
- [ ] 100% test coverage for critical paths
- [ ] Performance: Handle 100+ concurrent uploads
- [ ] Security: All endpoints authenticated and validated

## Technical Decisions
- Use file hash (SHA-256) as cache key for deduplication
- Store full analysis results in JSONB columns for flexibility
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Use asyncpg for database operations
- Consider Celery for background task processing

## Notes
- This implementation will enable automatic processing of C3D files as soon as they're uploaded from the mobile app
- The caching system will significantly improve performance for repeated analyses
- Database storage of results enables historical analysis and progress tracking
- Webhook approach provides real-time processing without polling overhead
