# Frontend Component Usage & Domain Analysis Plan

## Objective
Systematically analyze frontend component usage and dependencies to determine:
1. Usage patterns for each root-level component
2. Logical domain classification
3. Obsolete component detection  
4. Optimal domain-based organization following senior software engineering patterns

## Analysis Strategy

### Phase 1: Component Discovery & Current Structure
- [ ] Map current frontend/src directory structure
- [ ] Identify all root-level components for analysis
- [ ] Document current organization patterns

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Usage Analysis
For each target component, perform systematic search:

**Target Components for Analysis:**
- [ ] MuscleNameDisplay.tsx
- [ ] FileUpload.tsx
- [ ] C3DFileBrowser.tsx
- [ ] QuickSelect.tsx
- [ ] SessionConfigPanel.tsx
- [ ] SessionLoader.tsx
- [ ] SettingsPanel.tsx
- [ ] layout/FileMetadataBar.tsx
- [ ] layout/Header.tsx

**For Each Component:**
- [ ] Find ALL import statements across entire frontend/src
- [ ] Identify actual usage locations (not just imports)
- [ ] Document usage context and purpose
- [ ] Count total usage instances
- [ ] Analyze component dependencies and relationships

### Phase 3: Domain Classification Analysis
Group components by logical domains:

**Proposed Domains:**
- [ ] **Auth Domain**: Authentication, session management, user flows
- [ ] **C3D Domain**: File handling, metadata, browser, upload functionality  
- [ ] **Settings Domain**: Configuration panels, parameters, preferences
- [ ] **App-Core Domain**: Main application logic, orchestration
- [ ] **Shared Utilities**: Truly cross-domain reusable components

### Phase 4: Obsolete Component Detection
- [ ] Identify components with zero imports
- [ ] Find components imported but never used
- [ ] Detect redundant components with existing organized equivalents
- [ ] Document removal candidates with evidence

### Phase 5: Optimal Organization Design
- [ ] Propose final domain-based structure
- [ ] Follow senior software engineering patterns:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Minimal coupling between domains
  - High cohesion within domains
  - Logical grouping and naming
- [ ] Document migration strategy
- [ ] Provide evidence-based recommendations

## Tools & Methods
- **Grep**: Pattern-based searches for import/usage analysis
- **Read**: Examine specific components and their implementations
- **LS**: Directory structure discovery
- **Systematic Approach**: Evidence-based analysis with specific file paths and counts

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Usage Matrix**: Component → Import locations → Usage contexts
2. **Domain Classification**: Logical grouping with justifications
3. **Obsolete Component Report**: Removal candidates with evidence
4. **Optimal Structure Proposal**: Senior engineering patterns
5. **Migration Recommendations**: Evidence-based next steps

## Success Criteria
- Complete usage analysis with evidence (file paths, line numbers, usage counts)
- Clear domain boundaries following SOLID principles
- Actionable recommendations for component organization
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
