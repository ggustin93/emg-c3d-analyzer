Part 2: Architectural Plan for Integrating a "Therapist" Role
Adding a new user role requires careful planning to ensure security and maintain a clean, scalable codebase. The principle of Separation of Concerns is paramount here.[8][9][10][11]
Layer 1: Backend - Securing Data Access with Supabase
Your security foundation is at the database level. Never trust the client-side for access control.[12]
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Supabase: Supabase is built on PostgreSQL, which has robust RBAC capabilities.[13][14][15]
Define Roles: In your database, create distinct roles for your user types. For example:
code
SQL
CREATE ROLE researcher;
CREATE ROLE therapist;
User-Role Mapping: Create a table to map your Supabase users to these roles. This table could look like this:
code
SQL
CREATE TABLE public.user_roles (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  role TEXT NOT NULL
);
Custom JWT Claims: Use Supabase Auth Hooks to inject the user's role into their JWT upon login.[16] This makes the user's role available to your database policies and your frontend application.
Row Level Security (RLS): This is the most critical step for data segregation.[17][18]
Enable RLS on all tables containing sensitive patient data.
Create RLS policies that filter data based on the user's role from the JWT.
For the Therapist Role: The requirement is that they can only see a subset of patient data. You'll need a linking table that defines which therapists have access to which patients (PIDs). Let's call it therapist_patient_access.
code
SQL
-- Example RLS Policy for patient_data table
CREATE POLICY "Therapists can only see assigned patients"
ON public.patient_data FOR SELECT
TO therapist -- Apply this policy only to the 'therapist' role
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM therapist_patient_access
    WHERE therapist_patient_access.patient_id = patient_data.pid
    AND therapist_patient_access.therapist_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
Layer 2: Frontend - Efficient Separation of Concerns in React
Authentication and Role Management:
Create an AuthContext that fetches the user's profile and role upon login and makes this information available throughout the application. This hook will be the single source of truth for user authentication and authorization status.[19]
Component Architecture for Role-Based Views:
Presentational (Dumb) Components: Keep your UI components generic and reusable.[20][21][22] For example, a PatientDashboard component should just display the data it's given via props, without knowing whether the user is a researcher or a therapist.
Container (Smart) Components: These components will contain the logic. They will use the AuthContext to determine the user's role, fetch the appropriate data (Supabase's RLS will handle the filtering automatically), and then pass that data to the presentational components.
Role-Based Rendering: You can create a component or a custom hook to conditionally render UI elements based on the user's role.[23][24][25]
code
Jsx
// Example of a ProtectedRoute component
const ProtectedRoute = ({ allowedRoles, children }) => {
  const { userRole } = useAuth(); // from your AuthContext
  if (allowedRoles.includes(userRole)) {
    return children;
  }
  // Redirect or show an unauthorized message
  return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" />;
};
Layer 3: Integrating the "C3D Analysis" Functionality
Encapsulate the Logic: Refactor the "C3D analysis" prototype code into a self-contained, reusable React component or a custom hook (useC3DAnalysis). This component should accept patient data as a prop and not be concerned with where that data comes from.
Conditional Integration: In your patient view container component, you can now render the C3DAnalysis component and pass it the patient data. Since the data fetching is role-aware (thanks to RLS), the C3D analysis will naturally operate only on the data the user is permitted to see.
Source Code Structure Recommendation
A well-organized folder structure will enhance maintainability.
code
Code

By following this comprehensive plan, you can confidently migrate your application to a more modern and efficient technology stack while simultaneously enhancing its architecture to support new, complex requirements in a secure and scalable manner.
