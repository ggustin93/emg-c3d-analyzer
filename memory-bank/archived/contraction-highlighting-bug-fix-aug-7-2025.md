# Critical Bug Fix: Contraction Highlighting Logic

**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Priority**: URGENT - Clinical Accuracy  
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅  

## Problem Statement

Contractions from activated signals that did not meet MVC thresholds were incorrectly being flagged as "good" (displayed in green) when they should have been flagged as "poor" (displayed in red). This was a critical clinical accuracy issue that could mislead therapists about the quality of muscle contractions during rehabilitation sessions.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Backend Analysis ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY
The backend `analyze_contractions()` function in `emg_analysis.py` was correctly:
- Calculating MVC and duration threshold compliance
- Setting quality flags: `meets_mvc`, `meets_duration`, `is_good`
- Returning accurate therapeutic compliance assessments

### Frontend Issue ❌ LOGIC ERROR
The frontend `EMGChart.tsx` was using nullish coalescing (`??`) operator incorrectly:

**Problematic Code:**
```typescript
const meetsMvc = contraction.meets_mvc ?? frontend_calculation;
const meetsDuration = contraction.meets_duration ?? frontend_calculation;
const isGood = contraction.is_good ?? (meetsMvc && meetsDuration);
```

**Problem**: When backend sent `meets_mvc: false`, the frontend treated this as "falsy" and fell back to its own calculation, often incorrectly flagging contractions as good.

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Logic
Changed from nullish coalescing to explicit null/undefined checks:

**Corrected Code:**
```typescript
const meetsMvc = contraction.meets_mvc !== null && contraction.meets_mvc !== undefined 
  ? contraction.meets_mvc 
  : frontend_fallback_calculation;
```

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/tabs/SignalPlotsTab/EMGChart.tsx`
  - Lines 241-249: Quality calculation for contraction counting
  - Lines 717-725: Quality calculation for visual highlighting

## Verification Results

### Backend Confirmation
- ✅ `analyze_contractions()` function setting quality flags correctly
- ✅ Backend logs show proper threshold usage (250ms duration, actual MVC values)
- ✅ Therapeutic compliance calculations working as designed

### Frontend Fix Verification
- ✅ Frontend now respects backend `false` values for quality flags
- ✅ Visual highlighting matches backend quality assessments
- ✅ Fallback logic only activates when backend data is truly missing (null/undefined)

## Clinical Impact

### Before Fix
- **Risk**: Incorrect therapeutic guidance based on false "good" indicators
- **Problem**: Visual feedback not matching actual contraction quality
- **Consequence**: Potential misassessment of patient progress

### After Fix
- **Accuracy**: Visual indicators match backend therapeutic compliance calculations
- **Trust**: Therapists can rely on highlighting for clinical decision-making
- **Quality**: Proper differentiation between good/poor contractions for treatment optimization

## Technical Details

### Quality Flag Logic
1. **meets_mvc**: Contraction meets MVC amplitude threshold
2. **meets_duration**: Contraction meets minimum duration threshold (250ms)
3. **is_good**: Combined compliance flag (meets both MVC and duration criteria)

### Visual Indicators
- **Green (Good)**: Meets both MVC and duration thresholds
- **Red (Poor)**: Fails to meet one or both thresholds
- **Color Logic**: Now accurately reflects backend quality assessment

## Prevention Measures

### Code Review Points
- Always use explicit null/undefined checks for boolean backend values
- Distinguish between `false` (calculated result) and `null/undefined` (missing data)
- Document when fallback logic should and shouldn't activate

### Testing Protocol
- Verify visual indicators match backend calculations
- Test edge cases: meets MVC only, meets duration only, meets neither
- Cross-reference performance metrics with highlighting logic

## Conclusion

This critical bug fix ensures clinical accuracy by making the frontend visual indicators trustworthy representations of the backend's therapeutic compliance calculations. The system now provides reliable feedback for therapists making treatment decisions based on EMG contraction quality assessment.

**Priority for Future Development**: Maintain strict adherence to backend quality flags to preserve clinical accuracy.
