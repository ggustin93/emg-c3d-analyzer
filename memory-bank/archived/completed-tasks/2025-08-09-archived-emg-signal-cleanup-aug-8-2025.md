# EMG Signal Processing & Chart Display Cleanup
**Date:** August 8, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Objectives
1. Remove non-functional "Raw + RMS (backend)" option from the UI
2. Enhance RMS envelope processing with proper filtering pipeline
3. Fix contraction peak markers rendering outside chart boundaries
4. Fix duration threshold inconsistency in ExportTab constants

## Implementation Details

### 1. Removed "Raw + RMS (backend)" Option ✅
- **File Modified:** `frontend/src/components/tabs/SignalPlotsTab/SignalTypeSelect.tsx`
- **Change:** Removed 'raw_with_rms' from OPTIONS array (line 30)
- **Result:** Non-functional option no longer appears in dropdown, simplifying UI

### 2. Enhanced RMS Envelope Processing ✅
- **File Modified:** `backend/signal_processing.py`
- **Changes Implemented:**
  - Added high-pass filter (20Hz) to remove DC offset and baseline drift
  - Changed low-pass filter from 500Hz to 10Hz for proper envelope extraction
  - Updated processing pipeline: Raw → High-pass (20Hz) → Rectify → Low-pass (10Hz) → Smooth (50ms) → RMS Envelope
  
- **Clinical Justification:**
  - High-pass filter removes movement artifacts and baseline drift
  - Low-pass filter at 10Hz creates smooth envelope after rectification
  - 50ms moving average provides additional envelope refinement
  - This follows standard EMG processing best practices

### 3. Fixed Contraction Peak Markers ✅
- **File Modified:** `frontend/src/components/tabs/SignalPlotsTab/EMGChart.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Changed `ifOverflow="visible"` to `ifOverflow="discard"` for ReferenceDot (line 1182)
  - Changed `ifOverflow="visible"` to `ifOverflow="discard"` for ReferenceArea (line 1131)
  - Added `overflow-hidden` class to chart container (line 927)
  - Fixed TypeScript null checks for overlayDataKeys (lines 985, 1005)
  
- **Result:** Contraction markers now properly constrained within chart boundaries

### 4. Fixed Duration Threshold Inconsistency ✅
- **File Modified:** `frontend/src/components/tabs/ExportTab/constants.ts`
- **Change:** Updated `durationThreshold` from 2000ms to 250ms (line 30)
- **Result:** Aligned with system-wide standard established January 8, 2025

## Technical Impact
- **Signal Quality:** RMS envelope now properly filtered with clinical-standard processing
- **Visual Clarity:** Chart markers properly contained within boundaries
- **System Consistency:** Duration thresholds aligned across all components
- **Code Quality:** Removed deprecated UI option, improving maintainability

## Testing Notes
- Frontend builds successfully with fixed TypeScript errors
- Other unrelated TypeScript errors exist in ExportTab and mvcService (not addressed in this task)
- Signal processing pipeline now follows clinical best practices for EMG analysis

## Future Considerations
- Monitor RMS envelope quality with real C3D files
- Consider making filter parameters configurable for research purposes
- May need to adjust filter cutoff frequencies based on clinical feedback
