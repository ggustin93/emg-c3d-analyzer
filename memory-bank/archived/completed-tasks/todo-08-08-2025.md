# TODO - August 8, 2025

**Status**: EMG Contraction Highlighting Fix - ALMOST COMPLETE ‚ö°
**Priority**: HIGH - Clinical Accuracy

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY (August 7, 2025)
1. **Fixed hardcoded duration threshold fallbacks**
   - Line 191: Changed from 2000ms ‚Üí 250ms ‚úÖ
   - Line 666: Changed from 2000ms ‚Üí 250ms ‚úÖ
   - Now both qualitySummary and contractionAreas use correct backend-aligned defaults

2. **Previous fixes verified working**
   - Backend correctly using 250ms thresholds (confirmed in logs) ‚úÖ
   - Nullish coalescing logic fixed for quality flags ‚úÖ
   - MVC threshold display showing correct values ‚úÖ

## üîÑ PENDING TASKS FOR TOMORROW

### HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] **Test all contraction quality scenarios display correctly**
  - Test: meets MVC only (should be red/poor)
  - Test: meets duration only (should be red/poor) 
  - Test: meets both MVC and duration (should be green/good)
  - Test: meets neither (should be red/poor)
  - Verify visual indicators match backend quality flags

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] **Add database integration for MVC persistence**
  - Implement MVC value storage in Supabase
  - Connect MVC service to database for session continuity
  - Update MVC estimation workflow with persistence

## üß™ TESTING PROTOCOL

### Frontend Highlighting Verification
1. Upload a C3D file with known contraction patterns
2. Verify EMGChart highlighting matches backend calculations:
   - Green areas = contractions meeting both MVC (75%) and duration (250ms) thresholds
   - Red areas = contractions failing either MVC or duration criteria
3. Check legend displays correct threshold values from backend
4. Confirm debug console shows consistent 250ms usage throughout

### Backend/Frontend Sync Check
- Backend logs should show: `‚úÖ Using global threshold: 250.0ms`
- Frontend console should show: `finalThresholdMs: 250`
- No more 2000ms values anywhere in the calculation chain

## üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Clinical Accuracy**: Frontend visual indicators MUST accurately reflect backend therapeutic compliance calculations. Any misalignment could mislead therapists about patient progress.

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] Visual highlighting matches backend `is_good` flags 100%
- [ ] Duration thresholds consistent (250ms) across all components
- [ ] MVC thresholds display actual calculated values
- [ ] No hardcoded fallbacks that don't match backend defaults

## üìù NOTES FOR TOMORROW

### Current Issue Resolution Status
- **Environment Variables**: Fixed (Vite compatibility) ‚úÖ
- **Threshold Display**: Fixed (shows actual backend values) ‚úÖ 
- **Quality Flag Logic**: Fixed (respects backend boolean flags) ‚úÖ
- **Hardcoded Fallbacks**: Fixed (now uses 250ms consistently) ‚úÖ
- **Visual Highlighting**: NEEDS FINAL TESTING ‚è≥

### Technical Context
- Backend correctly calculates quality flags in `analyze_contractions()`
- Frontend EMGChart now uses consistent 250ms defaults throughout
- All nullish coalescing issues resolved
- System architecture aligned: Backend calculations ‚Üí Frontend display

### Expected Outcome
After tomorrow's testing, the frontend highlighting should perfectly follow backend calculations, ensuring clinical accuracy for therapeutic decision-making.

**Next Session Start**: Begin with comprehensive contraction quality testing using sample C3D files
