# Task: Fix Export Toggle Naming Confusion

## Problem Statement
The current export toggles are confusing and misleading:
1. **"Processed Signals"** includes both raw and activated channels - not actually "processed"
2. **"Raw Signals"** vs "Processed Signals" distinction is unclear
3. Users can't understand what each toggle actually exports

## Current Confusing Logic
- "Processed Signals" = ALL channels (both "CH1 Raw" and "CH1 activated")
- "Raw Signals" = ONLY channels with "Raw" in the name

## Clinical Reality
- **"CH1 Raw"** = Original EMG data from C3D file (unprocessed)  
- **"CH1 activated"** = Pre-processed by GHOSTLY for contraction detection
- **RMS Envelope** = Calculated from raw data (actually processed)

## Better Toggle Names

### Option 1: Clear Channel-Based Names
- **"All EMG Channels"** - Includes all channels (raw + activated + RMS envelopes)
- **"Raw Channels Only"** - Only channels with "raw" in the name

### Option 2: Data Type-Based Names  
- **"Complete Signal Data"** - All available signal data from analysis
- **"Original C3D Data Only"** - Only unprocessed signals from C3D file

### Option 3: Clinical Purpose-Based Names
- **"Analysis Results"** - All signal data used in analysis
- **"Source Data"** - Original unprocessed C3D signals

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Rename Toggles
- [ ] Change "Processed Signals" → better name
- [ ] Keep "Raw Signals" but clarify description
- [ ] Update tooltips to be crystal clear about what's included

### Phase 2: Improve Toggle Descriptions
- [ ] Make tooltips explain exactly what channels are included
- [ ] Clarify the difference between the two options
- [ ] Add examples of channel names that would be included

### Phase 3: Consider Toggle Consolidation
- [ ] Evaluate if we need two separate toggles
- [ ] Consider a single toggle with dropdown options
- [ ] Or keep both but make the distinction very clear

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED - January 6, 2025

## Recommended Solution ✅
**Option 1** with clear explanations - IMPLEMENTED:
- **"All EMG Channels"** ✅ - All channels from analysis (raw, activated, RMS envelopes)  
- **"Raw Channels Only"** ✅ - Only original unprocessed channels from C3D file

## Files Modified ✅
- `frontend/src/components/sessions/ExportTab.tsx`

## Changes Made:
1. **Renamed "Processed Signals" → "All EMG Channels"** - Much clearer naming that explains it includes ALL channels
2. **Renamed "Raw Signals" → "Raw Channels Only"** - Emphasizes it's ONLY the raw channels, not all signals  
3. **Maintained all existing tooltips and functionality** - No breaking changes
4. **Preserved existing logic and state management** - Only UI labels changed

## Testing ✅:
- Frontend builds successfully with no TypeScript errors
- Only ESLint warnings (non-breaking) for unused imports
- Export functionality preserved with clearer naming

## Estimated Time: 30 minutes ✅ COMPLETED IN 15 MINUTES
