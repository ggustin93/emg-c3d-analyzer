# Fix Contraction Highlighting Synchronization
**Date**: 2025-08-08
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Problem
The backend-calculated contraction quality flags (`is_good`, `meets_mvc`, `meets_duration`) were not being clearly reflected in the frontend EMG chart visualization, potentially causing confusion about which values were being used.

## Root Cause
While the frontend was technically using backend values when available, the conditional logic was complex and lacked clarity. Additionally, there was no validation to detect when backend and frontend calculations might differ.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Clarified Backend Priority Logic (EMGChart.tsx)
- Simplified the conditional checks to make it explicit when backend values are used
- Added clear variable names (`hasBackendMvc`, `hasBackendDuration`, `hasBackendGood`) to track data availability
- Ensured backend values are always preferred when available

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive logging showing:
  - Raw contraction data (amplitude, duration)
  - Threshold values being used
  - Backend values as received
  - Final values being used for visualization
  - Source of the values (backend vs frontend-calculated)

### 3. Added Validation Warnings
- Implemented mismatch detection between backend and frontend calculations
- Console warnings alert developers when calculations differ
- Helps identify threshold synchronization issues

### 4. Fixed TypeScript Issues
- Ensured proper type handling for nullable values
- Converted undefined values to boolean types where required
- Maintained type safety throughout the component

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **frontend/src/components/tabs/SignalPlotsTab/EMGChart.tsx**
   - Lines 238-278: Updated contraction quality calculation in legend
   - Lines 730-795: Updated contraction areas visualization logic
   - Added validation and enhanced logging throughout

## Testing Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. Backend values are always used when available
2. Clear logging shows which values are being used
3. Warnings appear if backend/frontend calculations differ
4. TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors

## Impact
- **Improved Clarity**: Clear separation between backend and frontend calculations
- **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps identify issues quickly
- **Validation**: Automatic detection of calculation mismatches
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more understandable code

## Future Considerations
- Monitor console logs during testing to ensure backend/frontend consistency
- If mismatches are detected, investigate threshold calculation differences
- Consider removing frontend fallback calculations once backend is fully reliable
