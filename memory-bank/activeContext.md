## Current Decisions and Discoveries

### Architecture
- **Stateless Backend**: Moving to a completely stateless backend approach where all data is processed on-demand and returned in a single API call, ideal for deployment on free-tier services like Render.
- **Clarity First**: Following the principle that "Clarity is King" - making the code easy to understand is a top priority.
- **No Breaking UI Changes**: The refactoring will maintain the same user experience while improving the internals.
- **Frontend-Focused Visualization**: All plotting will be done client-side with Recharts, eliminating server-side image generation.
- **Robust Channel Handling**: Implementing more flexible channel naming and detection to handle various C3D file formats.
- **Clinical Relevance**: Enhancing the EMG analysis with more advanced metrics for better rehabilitation assessment, focusing on contraction quality and fatigue estimation.
- **Standardized Clinical Measures**: Using established clinical scales like the Borg CR10 Scale for Rating of Perceived Exertion to ensure relevance and validity of patient-reported outcomes.
- **Reactive Frontend Architecture**: The frontend is now fully reactive. A centralized Zustand store manages all session parameters. Key components and analytics hooks subscribe to this store, allowing for instant, client-side recalculation of all metrics when settings are changed. This provides a highly interactive and responsive user experience for therapists.

### Troubleshooting
- **File System as Database**: The current approach uses the file system for data storage, which will be replaced by a stateless model where all necessary data is returned directly in API responses.
- **TypeScript Null Safety**: Careful attention to nullable types is required, especially when dealing with optional parameters like `metadata.duration`.
- **Tooltip Component Structure**: Radix UI tooltips require careful structuring to avoid runtime errors. The `TooltipProvider` should be used at the root level to avoid nesting issues.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1.  **Merge `feature/backend-streamlining` into `main`**: The feature branch is now complete and stable. All frontend enhancements and the new reactive architecture should be merged.
2.  Review and remove any remaining unused code or feature flags related to the old, static architecture.
3.  Begin Phase 2 of the backend refactoring with the integration of the new `emg_analysis.py` module.
4.  Update backend models to support the enhanced analysis capabilities.

### Future Considerations
1.  Database integration for more complex querying and data management.
2.  CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
3.  Additional game-specific analysis features based on user feedback.
4.  Further enhancement of patient-reported outcomes with additional clinical scales.
