    *   **Created Comprehensive Implementation Plan**: Developed detailed temporal analysis implementation plan (`memory-bank/temporal-analysis-implementation-plan.md`) with 4-phase approach covering core functions, integration, and clinical validation.
    *   **Improved UI Honesty**: Updated `StatsPanel.tsx` and `MuscleComparisonTable.tsx` to remove misleading "(avg ¬± std)" labels and replace with "(overall)" indicators, adding "Temporal Stats Coming Soon" badges to clearly communicate current capabilities and future plans.

## Current Decisions and Discoveries

### Architecture
- **Stateless Backend**: Moving to a completely stateless backend approach where all data is processed on-demand and returned in a single API call, ideal for deployment on free-tier services like Render.
- **Clarity First**: Following the principle that "Clarity is King" - making the code easy to understand is a top priority.
- **No Breaking UI Changes**: The refactoring will maintain the same user experience while improving the internals.
- **Frontend-Focused Visualization**: All plotting will be done client-side with Recharts, eliminating server-side image generation.
- **Robust Channel Handling**: Implementing more flexible channel naming and detection to handle various C3D file formats.
- **Clinical Relevance**: Enhancing the EMG analysis with more advanced metrics for better rehabilitation assessment, focusing on contraction quality and fatigue estimation.
- **Standardized Clinical Measures**: Using established clinical scales like the Borg CR10 Scale for Rating of Perceived Exertion to ensure relevance and validity of patient-reported outcomes.
- **Reactive Frontend Architecture**: The frontend is now fully reactive. A centralized Zustand store manages all session parameters. Key components and analytics hooks subscribe to this store, allowing for instant, client-side recalculation of all metrics when settings are changed. This provides a highly interactive and responsive user experience for therapists.

### Troubleshooting
- **File System as Database**: The current approach uses the file system for data storage, which will be replaced by a stateless model where all necessary data is returned directly in API responses.
- **TypeScript Null Safety**: Careful attention to nullable types is required, especially when dealing with optional parameters like `metadata.duration`.
- **Tooltip Component Structure**: Radix UI tooltips require careful structuring to avoid runtime errors. The `TooltipProvider` should be used at the root level to avoid nesting issues.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1.  **Merge `feature/backend-streamlining` into `main`**: The feature branch is now complete and stable. All frontend enhancements and the new reactive architecture should be merged.
2.  Review and remove any remaining unused code or feature flags related to the old, static architecture.
3.  Begin Phase 2 of the backend refactoring with the integration of the new `emg_analysis.py` module.
4.  Update backend models to support the enhanced analysis capabilities.

### Future Considerations
1.  Database integration for more complex querying and data management.
2.  CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
3.  Additional game-specific analysis features based on user feedback.
4.  Further enhancement of patient-reported outcomes with additional clinical scales.

## Latest Implementation: Threshold Display Synchronization ‚úÖ (January 8, 2025)

### MVC & Duration Threshold Display Fix
- **Backend-Frontend Synchronization**: Fixed EMGChart legend to display actual backend-calculated values instead of hardcoded defaults
- **MVC Threshold Accuracy**: Changed legend display from static `1.500e-4V` to actual backend value `1.125e-4V` 
- **Duration Threshold Consistency**: Updated all defaults from 2000ms to 250ms to match backend calculations
- **API Parameter Integration**: Added `contraction_duration_threshold` parameter to `/upload` and `/export` endpoints
- **Session Store Alignment**: Updated frontend session store default to 250ms for consistent threshold handling
- **Environment Variable Migration**: Fixed Vite compatibility issues by migrating from `process.env` to `import.meta.env`

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend Changes**: 
  - Added duration threshold parameter to API endpoints with 250ms default
  - Updated `GameSessionParameters` creation to include threshold values
  - Ensured session parameters are returned in `metadata.session_parameters_used`
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Fixed EMGChart legend line 398-400 to show `item.value` (actual threshold) instead of `mvcValue` (base value)
  - Updated session store default from 2000ms to 250ms to match backend
  - Fixed all fallback values throughout EMGChart component

- ‚úÖ Duration thresholds will display 250ms once session data refreshes
- ‚úÖ Vite environment variables working correctly with `import.meta.env`

## URGENT Critical Bug Fix: Contraction Highlighting Logic ‚úÖ (August 7, 2025)

### Problem Identified
- **Clinical Accuracy Issue**: Contractions from activated signals not meeting MVC thresholds were incorrectly flagged as "good" (green) instead of "poor" (red)
- **Root Cause**: Frontend EMGChart logic was overriding backend quality flags using `??` (nullish coalescing), treating `false` values as missing data

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend Quality Assessment**: Confirmed `analyze_contractions()` function correctly sets:
  - `meets_mvc`: Boolean flag for MVC threshold compliance
  - `meets_duration`: Boolean flag for duration threshold compliance  
  - `is_good`: Combined therapeutic compliance flag (meets both criteria)
- **Frontend Logic Fix**: Updated EMGChart.tsx lines 241-249 and 717-725 to respect backend calculations:
  - **Before**: `contraction.meets_mvc ?? frontend_calculation` (overwrote `false` with frontend calc)
  - **After**: Explicit null/undefined check to only use frontend fallback when backend data is truly missing

### Clinical Impact
- **Accurate Quality Assessment**: Visual indicators now match backend therapeutic compliance calculations
- **Correct Highlighting**: Contractions not meeting MVC/duration thresholds properly display as "poor" (red)
- **Trusted Clinical Decision-Making**: Therapists can rely on visual feedback for accurate treatment assessment

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/tabs/SignalPlotsTab/EMGChart.tsx`: Fixed quality flag logic in two locations
- Backend analysis confirmed working correctly with proper quality flag generation

## Latest Implementation: EMG Overlay System Fix ‚úÖ (August 8, 2025)

### Root Cause Analysis & Resolution
- **Channel Naming Mismatch Identified**: Backend `extract_emg_data()` created channels as "CH1", "CH2" but analysis pipeline looked for "CH1 Raw", "CH2 Raw"
- **Missing Raw Signals**: Only processed channels ("CH1 Processed", "CH2 Processed") reached frontend, preventing Raw + RMS overlay functionality
- **Frontend Implementation Correct**: EMGChart overlay logic was already properly implemented with dual Y-axes and proper signal handling

### Technical Solution Implemented
**File Modified**: `backend/processor.py` lines 167-184
- **Dual Channel Creation**: Modified `extract_emg_data()` to create both original C3D channel names AND "Raw" variants
- **Backend Compatibility**: Ensures analysis pipeline can find expected "{base_name} Raw" channels
- **Data Structure**: Maintains backward compatibility by storing both channel naming conventions

```python
# Store channel with original C3D name (e.g., "CH1")  
emg_data[channel_name] = channel_data

# ALSO store with "Raw" suffix for analysis pipeline compatibility
raw_channel_name = f"{channel_name} Raw"
emg_data[raw_channel_name] = channel_data.copy()
```

### Expected Results (Pending Test)
- ‚úÖ **Raw signals available**: "CH1 Raw", "CH2 Raw" for overlay left Y-axis
- ‚úÖ **Processed signals available**: "CH1 Processed", "CH2 Processed" for overlay right Y-axis  
- ‚úÖ **Dual-axis overlay functional**: Raw EMG (transparent) + RMS envelope (bold) on separate axes
- ‚úÖ **Debug output corrected**: `rawKeys` should populate, `hasValidOverlayData: true`

### Context for Follow-up
- **Testing Required**: Need to verify fix works with actual C3D file upload and Raw + RMS overlay selection
- **Previous Issue**: User reported "Raw + RMS" showed same as "Activated (C3D)" due to missing raw channels
- **Frontend Overlay Code**: Already correctly implemented in EMGChart.tsx with proper dual Y-axis configuration
- **Backend Integration**: Fix addresses channel naming mismatch at data extraction level

## Previous Implementation: Component Architecture Reorganization ‚úÖ (August 6, 2025)
- **Domain-Based Organization**: Systematic component reorganization by feature domain (c3d/, shared/, tabs/)
