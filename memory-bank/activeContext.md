# Active Context

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Features
âœ… Implemented:
- C3D file upload and processing
- EMG data extraction
- Contraction detection
- Basic analytics
- Plot generation
- Patient tracking
- REST API endpoints

ðŸš§ In Progress:
- Frontend development
- Advanced analytics
- Batch processing
- User authentication
- Data export features

### Recent Changes
1. Initial project setup with FastAPI
2. Implementation of C3D processing
3. Basic EMG analysis functionality
4. Plot generation capabilities
5. API endpoint structure
6. Updated `techContext.md` with Python dependencies from `poetry.lock` provided by the user.
7. Refactored `frontend/src/components/sessions/game-session-tabs.tsx` for improved layout: centered tabs, full-width plot and analytics sections, and more compact plot configuration.
8. Updated `frontend/src/components/app/ChannelSelection.tsx` with a `displayMode` prop for flexible rendering.
9. Refined `Plot Configuration` in `game-session-tabs.tsx` to be more subtle, using the new `ChannelSelection` display modes and a collapsible section for advanced plot options.
10. User identified that `@` path alias is not configured for frontend, leading to use of relative paths for UI component imports (e.g., `../ui/collapsible`).
11. User installed `Collapsible` component using `shadcn/ui` CLI, resolving import errors for `frontend/src/components/ui/collapsible`.
12. Implemented `useEffect` hooks in `game-session-tabs.tsx` to synchronize `selectedChannelForStats` and `plotChannel1Name`, ensuring the "Analyze Muscle" selection also drives the primary plot channel.
13. Refactored `frontend/src/App.tsx` into multiple custom hooks (`useDataDownsampling`, `useChannelManagement`, `useEmgDataFetching`, `useGameSessionData`) for improved modularity and state management.
14. Fixed overlapping legend in `frontend/src/components/EMGChart.tsx` by repositioning the legend to the bottom of the chart.

## Active Development Focus

### Priority Areas
1. Frontend Development
   - User interface design
   - API integration
   - Real-time updates
   - Interactive visualizations

2. Data Processing
   - Optimization of analysis
   - Additional metrics
   - Batch processing
   - Error handling

3. User Management
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - User roles
   - Access control

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. Need for comprehensive error handling
2. Limited test coverage
3. Basic file management system
4. Missing documentation
5. Performance optimization needed

### Bugs
1. No critical bugs identified
2. Minor issues:
   - Plot generation occasionally slow
   - File cleanup not automated
   - Missing input validation for some fields

## Current Decisions

### Architecture
- Maintaining FastAPI backend
- Local file storage for now
- Async processing where possible
- Modular component design

### Technology
- Python 3.10 compatibility
- Poetry for dependency management
- FastAPI for API framework
- ezc3d for file processing
- shadcn/ui for frontend UI components.

### Development
- Code style with Ruff
- Type checking with Pyright
- Testing with pytest
- Documentation in Markdown

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add a suitable icon for "Plot Options" trigger in `game-session-tabs.tsx` if desired.
2. Complete general frontend development (API integration, remaining UI refinements).
3. Implement user authentication.
4. Add advanced analytics.
5. Improve error handling.
6. Expand test coverage.

### Future Considerations
1. Database integration
2. Cloud storage options
3. Performance optimization
4. Scaling strategy
5. Security enhancements 
6. Configure path aliases (e.g., `@/*`) in `frontend/tsconfig.json` and bundler for cleaner imports.
