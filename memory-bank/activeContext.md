# Active Context

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Features
âœ… Implemented:
- C3D file upload and processing (Backend)
- EMG data extraction (Backend)
- Contraction detection (Backend)
- Basic analytics (Backend)
- Plot generation (Backend logic, basic frontend display)
- REST API endpoints (Core functionality for upload and data retrieval)
- Frontend UI for file upload, channel selection, and basic data/plot display.

ðŸš§ In Progress:
- Advanced frontend interactivity and visualizations.
- More comprehensive analytics and reporting features.
- User authentication and authorization.

### Recent Changes
*   Refactored `frontend/src/App.tsx` into multiple custom hooks.
*   Fixed UI issues like chart legends.
*   **Successfully deployed backend (FastAPI) to Render.**
    *   Resolved Python version conflicts by updating `pyproject.toml` (`python = ">=3.10.0,<3.12"`).
    *   Added `python-multipart` dependency for file uploads.
    *   Updated Render build command to `poetry install --only main --no-root`.
    *   Corrected Render start command to `uvicorn c3d_api:app ...`.
    *   Ensured `poetry.lock` is consistent with `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Successfully deployed frontend (React) to Vercel.**
    *   Configured frontend to use `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable to connect to the Render backend.
*   **Improved Project Setup and Documentation:**
    *   Updated `README.md` with detailed, professional setup and usage instructions.
    *   Deleted outdated `setup.sh`.
    *   Updated `start_dev.sh` to refer to `README.md` for setup.
    *   Corrected manual start command in `README.md` to `uvicorn c3d_api:app ...`.

## Active Development Focus

### Priority Areas
1.  **Backend Feature Enhancement (EMG Analysis):**
    *   Implement calculation and API exposure for:
        *   Root Mean Square (RMS)
        *   Mean Absolute Value (MAV)
        *   Spectral parameters (MPF, MDF)
        *   Dimitrov's Fatigue Index (FI_nsm5)
    *   Integrate these calculations into `c3d_processor.py`.
    *   Update relevant Pydantic models in `models.py` to include these new analytics.
    *   Extend API endpoints in `c3d_api.py` to return these new metrics.
2.  Frontend Development:
    *   Display new EMG analytics (RMS, MAV, fatigue indices) in the UI.
    *   Enhancing UI/UX based on deployed application and new data.
3.  Data Processing & Analytics:
    *   Optimization of analysis.
    *   Adding more comprehensive metrics and reports.
4.  Testing:
    *   Increasing test coverage for both backend and frontend.

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1.  Comprehensive error handling across the stack.
2.  Limited test coverage.
3.  Documentation within code (docstrings, comments).

### Bugs
*   No critical bugs identified post-deployment. Monitor deployed versions.

## Current Decisions

### Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI on Render.
- Frontend: React (Create React App) on Vercel.
- Local file storage for development; ephemeral on Render for backend.

### Technology
- Python (>=3.10,<3.12) with Poetry.
- FastAPI.
- React with TypeScript.
- `shadcn/ui` for frontend components.

### Development
- `start_dev.sh` as the primary way to run the local dev environment.
- `README.md` as the source of truth for setup.
- Code style with Ruff, type checking with Pyright.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1.  **Implement new EMG analytics (RMS, MAV, MPF, MDF, FI_nsm5) in the FastAPI backend.**
    *   Utilize provided Python functions as a base.
    *   Integrate into `c3d_processor.py`.
    *   Update API responses and data models.
2.  Thoroughly test the deployed application on Vercel and Render.
3.  Update frontend to display the new analytics parameters.
4.  Address any bugs or UI issues found in the deployed versions.
5.  Continue frontend development for advanced features.
6.  Work on increasing test coverage for backend calculations and frontend display.

### Future Considerations
1.  Database integration for persistent data storage if needed beyond C3D analysis.
2.  Cloud storage for C3D files and results.
3.  User authentication and roles.
4.  CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
