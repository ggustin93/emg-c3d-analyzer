# Active Context

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Features
âœ… Implemented:
- C3D file upload and processing (Backend)
- EMG data extraction and intelligent analysis (Backend)
- Complete analytics suite (RMS, MAV, MPF, MDF, FI_nsm5) (Backend)
- **Robust Frontend Component Architecture**:
    - Replaced `lucide-react` with `@radix-ui/react-icons` to resolve dependency conflicts.
    - Repaired `GameSessionTabs` component after a series of cascading type errors.
    - Implemented a full suite of `shadcn/ui` components, with a clear CLI-based workflow for adding more.
- **Advanced Plotting Features**:
    - Added an "easy switch" to toggle plots between "Raw" and "Activated" signal data.
    - The `useChannelManagement` hook now dynamically manages channel selection based on the plot mode.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**:
    - Default view after upload is now the "Signal Plots" tab.
    - The uploaded filename is now displayed.
    - The "Overview" tab has been renamed to "Game Stats" and reordered.
    - The `StatsPanel` has been refined to only show clinically relevant metrics, removing "Min/Max Value" to avoid confusion with "Min/Max Amplitude".
    - Corrected scientific notation formatting for very small numbers.

ðŸš§ In Progress:
- End-to-end testing of the full analysis and visualization pipeline.

### Recent Changes
*   **Resolved Frontend Build Issues**: Migrated the entire frontend from `lucide-react` to `@radix-ui/react-icons`, resolving persistent compilation errors.
*   **Implemented Plot Mode Switching**: Added a state to `App.tsx` and a `Switch` UI to `GameSessionTabs` to control the plot mode. Refactored `useChannelManagement` hook to react to this state, centralizing the logic.
*   **Refined Analytics Display**: Removed "Min/Max Value" from the `StatsPanel` to improve clinical clarity and focus on contraction-specific metrics. Updated component descriptions accordingly.
*   **Improved UX Flow**: Changed the default tab on upload to "Signal Plots" and added the filename to the session title.
*   **Fixed Data Formatting**: Corrected the `formatMetricValue` utility to ensure very small numbers are displayed in scientific notation rather than being rounded to zero.

## Active Development Focus

### Priority Areas
1.  **Stability and Testing**:
    *   Ensure the new plot-switching feature works reliably with different C3D files.
    *   Validate the end-to-end data flow now that the UI components have been stabilized.
2.  **Code Cleanup**:
    *   Review component props and state management for any further simplification opportunities now that the major bug fixes are complete.
3.  **Documentation**:
    *   Ensure all memory bank files are up-to-date with the latest changes.

## Current Decisions and Discoveries

### Architecture
- The frontend architecture is stabilizing around a pattern of a central `App.tsx` controlling state, which is passed down to modular, state-driven hooks (`useChannelManagement`, `useGameSessionData`, etc.) and then to display components (`GameSessionTabs`).
- **Design Philosophy**: The decision to remove the "Min/Max Value" cards establishes a key design principle: prioritize clinical relevance and clarity over displaying every possible raw metric.

### Troubleshooting
- **Frontend Dependency Management**: The migration to `@radix-ui/react-icons` and the use of the `shadcn@latest add` CLI are now the standard procedures for managing UI components and resolving related dependency issues.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1.  Perform a full user-flow test: upload a file, switch between plot modes, and review all analytics tabs to confirm stability.
2.  Review the `useGameSessionData` and `useChannelManagement` hooks for any redundant state or logic.

### Future Considerations
1.  Database integration for persistent data storage.
2.  User authentication and roles.
3.  CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
