### Frontend Development
âœ… **Major Refactoring & Component Stabilization:**

âœ… **Advanced Plotting Features**:
    - âœ… Added a toggle switch to flip between "Raw" and "Activated" channel plots.
    - âœ… Channel selection logic is now dynamic and centralized in `useChannelManagement`.
    - âœ… Implemented zoom/pan functionality using Recharts Brush component.
    - âœ… Added MVC threshold reference line for visual feedback.
âœ… **Game Session Analysis UI**:
    - âœ… Created SessionConfigPanel for inputting game session parameters.
    - âœ… Updated StatsPanel to display good contractions count.
    - âœ… Added visual MVC threshold indicator on EMG charts.
âœ… **Significant UI/UX Polish:**
    - âœ… Default view is now "Signal Plots" tab after upload.
    - âœ… Display uploaded filename in the session title.
    - âœ… Renamed "Overview" to "Game Stats" and reordered tabs.
    - âœ… `StatsPanel` refined to show only clinically relevant amplitude metrics.
    - âœ… Fixed number formatting to correctly display scientific notation.
    - âœ… Finalized tab bar layout (removed redundant tab, restored full-width style).
    - âœ… **Enhanced UI Components**:
        - âœ… Created a centralized color system in `colorMappings.ts` for consistent styling.
        - âœ… Implemented a reusable `ViewSelector` component for view mode switching.
        - âœ… Fixed tooltip rendering issues by properly structuring `TooltipProvider` components.
        - âœ… Improved muscle naming with structured dropdowns in `SettingsPanel`.
        - âœ… Enhanced `MuscleSelector` to work with the view mode system.
        - âœ… Updated `EMGChart` to support both single and comparison views with consistent colors.
âœ… **Frontend Caching**: Implemented in-memory caching for plot data to avoid redundant API calls.
âœ… API Integration for all core features.
âœ… UI Components from `shadcn/ui`.
