# Progress Tracking

## Completed Features

### Core Infrastructure
âœ… **Backend Codebase Refactoring** (Moved all backend logic into a dedicated `backend/` directory)
âœ… FastAPI Application Setup (Backend)
âœ… Poetry Project Configuration (Backend)
âœ… React Application Setup (Frontend - Create React App)
âœ… Directory Structure Established
âœ… Basic Error Handling (Initial versions)
âœ… CORS Support (Backend)
âœ… `start_dev.sh` for unified local development server start.
âœ… `README.md` significantly improved for professional open-source standards.
âœ… Local setup process streamlined (deleted `setup.sh`, `README.md` is source of truth).

### Data Processing & Analytics (Backend)
âœ… C3D File Upload
âœ… EMG Data Extraction
âœ… **Intelligent Analysis Pipeline:**
    - âœ… Correctly identifies "Raw" vs. "activated" signals.
    - âœ… Applies contraction analysis *only* to activated signals.
    - âœ… Applies full-signal metrics *only* to raw signals.
âœ… **Complete Analytics Suite:**
    - âœ… RMS (Root Mean Square)
    - âœ… MAV (Mean Absolute Value)
    - âœ… MPF (Mean Power Frequency)
    - âœ… MDF (Median Frequency)
    - âœ… Dimitrov's Fatigue Index (FI_nsm5)
âœ… **Aggregated API Response:**
    - âœ… API returns a clean, unified analytics object per muscle.
    - âœ… API includes the `source_filename` in the response.
âœ… Plot Generation (Backend logic)

### API Endpoints (Backend)
âœ… File Upload (`/upload`)
âœ… Raw Data Access (`/raw-data/{result_id}/{channel_name}`)
âœ… Results Retrieval

### Frontend Development
âœ… **Major Refactoring & Component Stabilization:**
    - âœ… Replaced `lucide-react` with `@radix-ui/react-icons` to solve build errors.
    - âœ… Repaired and stabilized `GameSessionTabs` and child components.
    - âœ… Established `shadcn/ui` with `@radix-ui/react-icons` as the core UI component stack.
    - âœ… Refactored state management into custom hooks (`useChannelManagement`, `useGameSessionData`).
âœ… **Advanced Plotting Features**:
    - âœ… Added a toggle switch to flip between "Raw" and "Activated" channel plots.
    - âœ… Channel selection logic is now dynamic and centralized in `useChannelManagement`.
âœ… **Significant UI/UX Polish:**
    - âœ… Default view is now "Signal Plots" tab after upload.
    - âœ… Display uploaded filename in the session title.
    - âœ… Renamed "Overview" to "Game Stats" and reordered tabs.
    - âœ… `StatsPanel` refined to show only clinically relevant amplitude metrics.
    - âœ… Fixed number formatting to correctly display scientific notation.
âœ… API Integration for all core features.
âœ… UI Components from `shadcn/ui`.

### Deployment
âœ… **Backend (FastAPI) successfully deployed to Render.**
    - Python version conflicts resolved.
    - `python-multipart` dependency added and working.
    - Build and start commands configured correctly.
âœ… **Frontend (React) successfully deployed to Vercel.**
    - Connected to Render backend via `REACT_APP_API_URL`.

## In Progress Features

### Testing (ðŸš§ 20%)
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for the `GHOSTLYC3DProcessor` logic.
- [ ] Add frontend tests for plot switching and data display logic.
- [ ] Validate correctness of all calculated metrics with known data sets.

### User Management (ðŸš§ 5% - If pursued)
- [ ] Requirements definition for authentication/authorization.

## Pending Features

### General
- [ ] Database integration for persistent storage.
- [ ] Cloud storage for C3D files.
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Core Functionality & Initial Deployment âœ…
- Basic API structure and C3D processing (Backend).
- Basic EMG analysis and plot generation (Backend).
- Functional frontend for upload and basic visualization.
- Successful deployment of decoupled frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render).

### Milestone 2: Intelligent Analysis & Frontend Refactor âœ…
- **Implemented intelligent, scientifically valid analysis pipeline in backend.**
- **Implemented the full suite of advanced EMG analytics.**
- **Refactored the frontend to correctly consume and display the new aggregated data.**

### Milestone 3: UI Polish, Stability & Feature Enhancement âœ…
