# Progress Tracking

## Completed Features

### Core Infrastructure
‚úÖ FastAPI Application Setup (Backend)
‚úÖ Poetry Project Configuration (Backend)
‚úÖ React Application Setup (Frontend - Create React App)
‚úÖ Directory Structure Established
‚úÖ Basic Error Handling (Initial versions)
‚úÖ CORS Support (Backend)
‚úÖ `start_dev.sh` for unified local development server start.
‚úÖ `README.md` significantly improved for professional open-source standards.
‚úÖ Local setup process streamlined (deleted `setup.sh`, `README.md` is source of truth).

### Data Processing (Backend)
‚úÖ C3D File Upload
‚úÖ EMG Data Extraction
‚úÖ Contraction Detection
‚úÖ Basic Analytics
‚úÖ Plot Generation (Backend logic)

### API Endpoints (Backend)
‚úÖ File Upload (`/upload`)
‚úÖ Raw Data Access (`/raw-data/{file_id}/{channel_name}`)
‚úÖ Basic Results Retrieval (structure in place)

### Frontend Development
‚úÖ Initial UI for File Upload and basic data display.
‚úÖ Refactored `App.tsx` into custom hooks (`useDataDownsampling`, `useChannelManagement`, `useEmgDataFetching`, `useGameSessionData`).
‚úÖ Fixed UI issues (e.g., chart legend overlapping).
‚úÖ Configured to use `REACT_APP_API_URL` for backend communication.

### Deployment
‚úÖ **Backend (FastAPI) successfully deployed to Render.**
    - Python version conflicts resolved.
    - `python-multipart` dependency added and working.
    - Build and start commands configured correctly.
‚úÖ **Frontend (React) successfully deployed to Vercel.**
    - Connected to Render backend via `REACT_APP_API_URL`.

## In Progress Features

### Backend Development (EMG Analysis) (üöß 10%)
- [ ] Implement RMS (Root Mean Square) calculation.
- [ ] Implement MAV (Mean Absolute Value) calculation.
- [ ] Implement MPF (Mean Power Frequency) calculation.
- [ ] Implement MDF (Median Frequency) calculation.
- [ ] Implement Dimitrov's Fatigue Index (FI_nsm5) calculation.
- [ ] Integrate new analytics into `c3d_processor.py`.
- [ ] Update API models and responses in `c3d_api.py` and `models.py`.

### Frontend Development (üöß 80% -> towards initial usable version)
- [x] Component Design (Basic layout for `game-session-tabs.tsx` improved, `ChannelSelection` made flexible)
- [x] UI Component Setup (`shadcn/ui` usage pattern established).
- [x] Core UI Logic (`game-session-tabs.tsx`: collapsible plot options, channel/stats sync).
- [x] Major refactoring of `App.tsx` completed.
- [x] Chart legend display issue resolved.
- [x] API Integration for core features (upload, data fetching for plots).
- [ ] Comprehensive User Interface (Further refinements, more interactive elements, polished look & feel based on deployed version).
- [ ] Robust real-time updates and feedback during processing.
- [ ] Advanced interactive plots and analytics display.

### Advanced Analytics (Backend & Frontend) (üöß 25%)
- [ ] Add more detailed EMG metrics (RMS, MAV, MPF, MDF, FI_nsm5 now planned).
- [ ] Implement trend analysis visualization (if applicable).
- [ ] Design and implement custom reports.
- [ ] Data export functionality.

### User Management (üöß 5% - If pursued)
- [ ] Requirements definition for authentication/authorization.

## Pending Features

### General
- [ ] Comprehensive end-to-end testing of deployed versions.
- [ ] Database integration for persistent storage (if required beyond current scope).
- [ ] Cloud storage for C3D files (if required for scaling).
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup.

### Security
- [ ] Thorough input validation on all API endpoints.
- [ ] Review security best practices for FastAPI and React.

### Performance
- [ ] Identify and optimize any slow backend processing steps.
- [ ] Optimize frontend rendering performance for large datasets.

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- Basic API Tests (Backend) ‚úÖ
- Model Tests (Backend) ‚úÖ
- Processor Tests (Backend) üöß
- Frontend component tests ‚ùå

### Integration Tests
- File Upload Flow (Backend & Frontend) üöß (Works, but needs formal tests)
- Processing Pipeline (Backend) üöß
- Error Handling (End-to-end) ‚ùå

## Known Issues

### High Priority
1.  Limited test coverage across the application.
2.  Frontend needs more robust error display and user feedback for API operations.

### Low Priority
1.  Plot generation performance for very large datasets (frontend/backend).
2.  Code documentation (docstrings, detailed comments).

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Core Functionality & Initial Deployment ‚úÖ
- Basic API structure and C3D processing (Backend).
- Basic EMG analysis and plot generation (Backend).
- Functional frontend for upload and basic visualization.
- **Successful deployment of decoupled frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render).**

### Milestone 2: Feature Enhancement & Polish üöß
- **Implement advanced EMG analytics (RMS, MAV, MPF, MDF, FI_nsm5) in backend.**
- **Display new EMG analytics in frontend.**
- Advanced frontend UI/UX and interactivity.
- More comprehensive analytics and reporting.
- Improved error handling and user feedback.
- Increased test coverage.

### Milestone 3: Production Ready ‚ùå
