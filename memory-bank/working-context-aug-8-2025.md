# Working Context - August 8, 2025
**Status**: BULK COMMIT MISTAKE - Need to track individual file changes next time

## What Just Happened (Mistake)
- User requested cleanup of repo and commit
- I interpreted this as "bulk commit everything" 
- **User actually wanted**: Individual file tracking and selective commits
- **What I did**: Committed 87 files in one big commit (0220c43)

## Commit Made (0220c43)
**Branch**: `feature/raw-signal-priority`
**Files**: 87 files changed, 5,893 insertions, 657 deletions

### Major Changes Committed:
1. **DDD Architecture Migration**:
   - `backend/processor.py` → `backend/application/processor.py`
   - `backend/api.py` → `backend/interfaces/api.py`
   - `backend/config.py` → `backend/core/config.py`
   - `backend/models.py` → `backend/domain/models.py`
   - `backend/export_utils.py` → `backend/infrastructure/exporting.py`

2. **New Files Added**:
   - `backend/application/mvc_service.py`
   - `backend/application/processor_service.py`
   - `backend/domain/analysis.py`
   - `backend/domain/processing.py`
   - `backend/test_rigorous_pipeline.py`
   - `backend/test_three_channel_integration.py`
   - `backend/tests/domain/test_contraction_flags.py`
   - `frontend/src/components/tabs/SignalPlotsTab/SignalTypeSelect.tsx`
   - `frontend/src/components/tabs/SignalPlotsTab/ThreeChannelSignalSelector.tsx`
   - `frontend/src/hooks/useMvcService.ts`
   - `frontend/src/services/mvcService.ts`
   - `docs/architecture-ddd.md`
   - `docs/signal-processing-pipeline.md`
   - `docs/signal-processing.md`

3. **Cleanup Done**:
   - Deleted: `VITE_MIGRATION_BASELINE.md`, `.dev_pids`, `frontend/.dev_pids`
   - Removed: `fix-frontend-cache.js`, `.serena/cache/`, `.serena/memories/`
   - Archived: Multiple completed task files to `memory-bank/archived/`

4. **Modified Files** (83+ files):
   - Almost every frontend component updated
   - Backend files modified for new architecture
   - Memory bank files updated
   - Log files, configuration files, etc.

## For Next Time - What User Wanted:
1. **Review each modified file individually** before staging
2. **Create logical, focused commits** (not one massive commit)
3. **Track what each change does** and why it was made
4. **Selective staging** - pick which changes to include per commit

## Recovery Options:
1. **If user wants to undo**: `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (keeps changes staged)
2. **If user wants to split**: Use interactive rebase or reset and recommit in pieces
3. **If user wants individual tracking**: Next time use `git add -p` for interactive staging

## Lesson Learned:
- Always clarify commit strategy before bulk operations
- "Commit changes" doesn't mean "commit everything at once"
- User likely wanted: review → selective stage → focused commits → push

## Current State:
- All changes are committed and pushed to `feature/raw-signal-priority`
- Repository is clean but commit history lacks granularity
- Next session should ask about commit strategy preferences

## Next Session Protocol:
1. Always ask: "Do you want to review files individually before committing?"
2. Use: `git status --porcelain | head -10` to show manageable chunks
3. Offer: `git add -p` for interactive staging
4. Create: Focused commits with clear, single-purpose messages
