# Memory Bank Organization

This directory contains the project's memory bank - critical documentation for maintaining context across development sessions.

## Active Documentation (Root Level)

### Core Context Files
- `activeContext.md` - Current implementation status and recent changes
- `progress.md` - Comprehensive feature completion tracking
- `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document (project scope and requirements)
- `productContext.md` - Why this project exists and how it should work
- `systemPatterns.md` - System architecture and design patterns  
- `techContext.md` - Technologies used and development setup

## Organized Archives

### `archived/`
Historical implementation records and completed feature documentation

#### `contraction-visualization/`
- Technical documentation for contraction visualization system
- Implementation completion records
- Feature-specific technical details

#### `legacy-docs/`
- Superseded implementation plans
- Historical project status snapshots
- Completed milestone documentation

### `future-work/`
Planned features and pending implementation tasks
- `todo-temporal-analysis-implementation-plan.md` - Windowed temporal analysis system

### `research/`
Active research questions and investigations
- `todo-activated-channels-research.md` - GHOSTLY "Activated" channel processing research

## Usage Guidelines

**For New Sessions**: Always read the core context files first:
1. `activeContext.md` - Current status
2. `progress.md` - What's been completed
3. `projectbrief.md` - Project foundation

**For Specific Features**: Check relevant archived documentation for implementation details and technical context.

**For Future Development**: Review future-work directory for planned enhancements and pending tasks.

## Maintenance

The memory bank is actively maintained to ensure:
- Current context remains accurate
- Historical records are preserved
- Documentation stays organized and accessible
- Future development is supported with proper context
