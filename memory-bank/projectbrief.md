# EMG C3D Analyzer (GHOSTLY+)

## Project Overview
EMG C3D Analyzer is a specialized tool designed to process and analyze EMG (Electromyography) data from C3D files generated by the GHOSTLY rehabilitation game platform. The system provides comprehensive analysis and visualization of muscle activity data to support rehabilitation monitoring and assessment.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Process C3D files containing EMG data from GHOSTLY game sessions
2. Detect and analyze muscle contractions
3. Generate visual analytics and reports, including standard EMG amplitude and fatigue parameters.
4. Track patient progress over time
5. Provide a RESTful API for integration with other systems

### Key Features
- C3D file upload and processing
- EMG signal analysis and contraction detection
- Calculation of EMG amplitude parameters (e.g., RMS, MAV)
- Calculation of EMG fatigue indices (e.g., MPF, MDF, Dimitrov's FI_nsm5)
- Real-time data visualization
- Patient progress tracking
- Multi-channel EMG analysis
- Automated report generation
- REST API endpoints for data access

### Target Users
- Physical Therapists
- Rehabilitation Researchers
- Healthcare Professionals
- GHOSTLY Game Platform Administrators

## Technical Scope
- FastAPI-based REST API
- Python-based EMG signal processing, including RMS, MAV, MPF, MDF, and fatigue indices.
- Data visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- C3D file handling with ezc3d
- Patient data management
- Secure file storage and processing

## Success Criteria
1. Accurate EMG contraction detection
2. Real-time processing capabilities
3. Intuitive data visualization
4. Reliable patient data tracking
5. Seamless integration with GHOSTLY platform
6. Scalable data storage and retrieval
7. Comprehensive API documentation
