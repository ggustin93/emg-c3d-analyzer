# EMG C3D Analyzer (GHOSTLY+)

A web-based tool for the analysis and visualization of Electromyography (EMG) data from C3D files, specifically designed and customized for C3D files generated by the GHOSTLY rehabilitation serious game platform.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress**: This application is currently under active development. Some features are incomplete and EMG analysis algorithms have not yet been clinically validated. This tool is specifically customized for C3D files from the GHOSTLY serious game and may not work correctly with C3D files from other sources without modification.

## Core Features

*   **GHOSTLY-Specific C3D Processing:** Ingests C3D files from the GHOSTLY game and distinguishes between "Raw" and "Activated" EMG signals based on GHOSTLY's specific channel naming conventions. *Note: Research is ongoing to understand the processing applied to "Activated" channels for optimal temporal analysis implementation.*
*   **EMG Analytics (WIP):** Calculates basic metrics for muscle fatigue and activity, including RMS, MAV, MPF, MDF, and Dimitrov's Fatigue Index. *Note: Statistical analysis and clinical validation are currently in development.*
*   **Contractions Detection & Analysis:** Identifies muscle contractions using adaptive thresholding with configurable parameters for duration and amplitude, providing detailed metrics on contraction count, duration, and intensity.
*   **Advanced Contraction Visualization:** Real-time visual feedback with background highlighting for contraction periods and peak markers with quality indicators (‚úì/‚úó). Features interactive toggle controls for Good/Poor contractions and Areas/Dots visibility.
*   **Performance Analysis of Rehabilitation Sessions:** Evaluates rehabilitation progress through analysis of contractions and exercise quality metrics compared to the rehabilitation protocol.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** Real-time EMG signal plotting with multi-channel comparison, comprehensive performance metrics dashboard, and dynamic legend showing contraction quality statistics.
*   **Session Configuration:** Game session parameter management with MVC threshold settings and basic performance tracking.
*   **Stateless Architecture:** Optimized for cloud deployment with efficient data bundling and client-side processing.
*   **Modern Technology Stack:** Built with FastAPI backend and React/TypeScript frontend with Zustand state management.

## Disclaimers

### üöß Development Status
This application is actively under development with several features in various stages of completion:
- **EMG Analysis Algorithms**: Basic implementation complete, but statistical analysis and clinical validation are ongoing
- **Channel Detection**: Currently optimized for GHOSTLY C3D file format and channel naming conventions
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculations implemented but may require clinical validation for research use
- This tool is intended for research and educational purposes within the GHOSTLY rehabilitation game context.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Git
*   Python 3.10+
*   Poetry
*   Node.js (LTS) & npm

### 1. Clone & Setup

First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggustin93/emg-c3d-analyzer.git
cd emg-c3d-analyzer
```
### 2. Configure Virtual Environment (Recommended)

To ensure the `start_dev.sh` script works seamlessly, configure Poetry to create the virtual environment inside the project folder:
```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

### 3. Run the Development Environment

The `start_dev.sh` script is the recommended way to launch the entire application. It handles all dependencies and starts both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

**First, make the script executable:**
```bash
chmod +x start_dev.sh
```

**To run the development server:**
```bash
./start_dev.sh
```
*   **Backend API:** `http://localhost:8080`
*   **Frontend App:** `http://localhost:3000`

**For a clean dependency reinstall (if you encounter module errors):**
```bash
./start_dev.sh --clean
```
This will delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` before installing, which can resolve caching issues.

## Configuration

### Frontend API Endpoint

The frontend defaults to connecting to the backend at `http://localhost:8080`. To override this (for example, in a production deployment), you can either:

1.  Create a `frontend/.env` file with `REACT_APP_API_URL=your_backend_url`.
2.  Set the `REACT_APP_API_URL` as an environment variable in your deployment platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
