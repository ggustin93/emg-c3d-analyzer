"""Performance Scores Normalization Test.

========================================================================

CRITICAL TEST: Validates that performance scores are properly calculated
and saved with normalized completion rates that don't exceed 1.0.

This test verifies the fix for:
1. Database fetch timing issues (using in-memory analytics data)
2. Completion rates exceeding 1.0 causing constraint violations

The fix implements:
1. _create_session_metrics_from_analytics() to use in-memory data
2. Rate normalization capping all rates at 1.0

KISS Principle: Focused test for one specific issue
DRY Principle: Reusable mock setup and assertion helpers  
SOLID Principle: Single responsibility - tests normalization only
