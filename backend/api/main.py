"""
GHOSTLY+ EMG Analysis API - Main Application
===========================================

FastAPI application factory with modular route organization.
Follows SOLID principles with clean separation of concerns.

ARCHITECTURE:
============
- App Factory Pattern: Clean initialization and configuration
- Modular Routes: Single responsibility route modules
- Dependency Injection: Service abstraction and injection
- Middleware Management: CORS and error handling centralized
