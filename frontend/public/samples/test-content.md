# Test Markdown File in Samples Directory

This is a test to verify if markdown files placed in the `/samples/` directory are accessible on Vercel deployment.

## Test Information
- **Location**: `/frontend/public/samples/test-content.md`

- **Date**: 2025-09-19

## Expected Outcome

1. Vercel serves the `/samples/` directory
2. Markdown files work in this location
3. We can use this pattern for FAQ and About content
