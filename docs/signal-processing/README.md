### ðŸ“Š [Signal Types & Processing](./signal-types-architecture.md)
**Start here** - Understanding the three signals: Raw, Activated, RMS Envelope
- Visual signal comparison with clinical context
- Processing pipeline with LaTeX formulas
- Why dual signals improve detection accuracy

### ðŸŽ¯ [Contraction Detection Algorithm](./contraction-detection.md) 
**Core Innovation** - Dual signal detection eliminates baseline noise
- Activated signal (5%) â†’ timing boundaries
- RMS envelope (10%) â†’ amplitude assessment  
- Clinical validation: +13% detection improvement

### ðŸ“ˆ [Clinical Scoring (MVC System)](./mvc-calibration.md)
**Quality Assessment** - Clinical threshold management
- MVC estimation hierarchy and confidence scoring
- Three-tier contraction classification
- Database integration for personalized thresholds

### ðŸ”¬ [Advanced Analysis (Spectral)](./spectral-analysis.md)
**Frequency Domain** - Fatigue and muscle characteristics
- Mean/Median Power Frequency analysis
- Temporal statistics across time windows
- Clinical applications for rehabilitation

## Implementation Status âœ…

- **Dual Signal Detection**: Implemented (August 2025)
- **Baseline Noise Resolution**: Eliminated false positives
- **Clinical Validation**: +13% contraction detection improvement
- **Parameter Optimization**: Research-validated thresholds
