# EMG C3D Analyzer - Claude Development Context

## üö® CRITICAL: START HERE - MODE PROTOCOL
**EVERY TASK MUST BEGIN IN PLAN MODE**

### # Mode: PLAN (Always start here)
- **NEVER start implementing immediately**
- Create detailed plan first in `memory-bank/tasks/TASK_NAME.md`
- Get explicit user approval with "ACT" command
- Return to PLAN mode after every response

### Mode Rules:
- **Start**: `# Mode: PLAN` at beginning of EVERY response
- **Transition**: Only when user explicitly types `ACT`
- **Return**: Back to PLAN mode after every implementation response
- **Reminder**: If user asks for action in plan mode, remind them to approve plan first
- **Planning**: Always output the full updated plan in every planning response

## üß† MANDATORY: READ MEMORY BANK FIRST
**BEFORE ANY TASK - READ ALL 5 CORE FILES:**
1. `projectbrief.md` - What this project is (foundation)
2. `activeContext.md` - Current status & recent work
3. `progress.md` - What's completed
4. `systemPatterns.md` - How the system works (architecture)
5. `techContext.md` - Tech stack & development setup

**NO EXCEPTIONS - THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL**

Memory resets completely between sessions. The Memory Bank is your ONLY link to previous work.

## ‚úÖ MANDATORY WORKFLOW CHECKLIST

## **MINIMALIST DOCUMENTATION ARCHITECTURE**

The project follows a **2-Layer Documentation Strategy** (Git provides archival):

### **üìÅ `/memory-bank/` - Claude Session Context**
**üß† ALWAYS READ THESE 5 CORE FILES FIRST:**
1. `projectbrief.md` - What this project is (foundation)
2. `activeContext.md` - Current status & recent work
3. `progress.md` - What's completed
4. `systemPatterns.md` - How the system works (architecture)
5. `techContext.md` - Tech stack & development setup

**üìã Reference Documents:**
- `productContext.md` - Why this project exists
- `metricsDefinitions.md` - EMG analysis definitions

**üìÅ Organized Context:**
- `future-work/` - Planned features
- `research/` - Active investigations  
- `archived/` - Historical context & completed features

### **üìÅ `/docs/` - Working Technical Documentation**
**For Developers RIGHT NOW:**
- `README.md` - Quick start guide
- `api.md` - FastAPI endpoint reference
- `db_schema.md` - Database schema
- `setup/` - Development environment setup

### **Git-Based Archival**
**Historical context preserved through:**
- Git commit history and branches
- `/memory-bank/archived/` for important context

**Critical**: The memory bank is your ONLY link to previous work. Read the 5 core files before starting ANY task to ensure continuity and prevent duplicate work.

## **Documentation Standards**

### **Working Documentation (`/docs/`)**
- **API Documentation**: Concise FastAPI endpoint reference (Swagger-style)
- **Database Schema**: Current Supabase state via MCP inspection only
- **Setup Guides**: Development environment and tool configuration
- **NO HALLUCINATION**: Only document actual, verified implementations

### **Memory Bank Updates**
Update memory bank when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes  
3. When user requests **"update memory bank"** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

### **Project Intelligence**
The `.cursor/rules` file captures important patterns and insights:
- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow patterns
- Project-specific technical decisions
- Known challenges and solutions
- Evolution of architectural decisions

**Remember**: After every memory reset, the Memory Bank is your ONLY link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity.

### Git Control Points (if enabled)

- Feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/TASK_NAME`
- Atomic commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` + reference plan

### Known Issues & Solutions

1. **Authentication Loading Loop** - Fixed infinite "Waiting for authentication to initialize..." loop
2. **C3D File Processing** - Backend must handle various C3D channel naming conventions
3. **EMG Signal Quality** - Ensure proper filtering and noise floor requirements
4. **Stateless Architecture** - Process data on-demand without persistent file storage
5. **Clinical Standards** - Maintain FDA Class II medical device compliance

## Project Overview
GHOSTLY+ EMG C3D Analyzer - A rehabilitation technology platform that processes C3D files from the GHOSTLY game to extract and analyze EMG (Electromyography) data for therapeutic assessment.

## Current Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python, processes C3D files, calculates EMG metrics
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with CRACO build system, Recharts for visualization
- **State Management**: Zustand for session parameters
- **Data Flow**: Upload ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Visualize

## Development Guidelines
- **No Breaking UI Changes**: Maintain current user experience
- **Stateless Backend**: Process data on-demand without persistent file storage
- **Clarity First**: Prioritize code readability and maintainability
- **Clinical Relevance**: Focus on medically meaningful EMG analysis

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Client-Side Plotting**: All visualization handled by React/Recharts
2. **Bundled Response**: Single API response contains all necessary data
3. **Flexible Channel Handling**: Robust to different C3D channel naming
4. **Advanced EMG Analysis**: Comprehensive biomedical metrics with clinical documentation

## Current Phase: Implementation
Working through todo.md tasks to refactor for:
- Backend streamlining (remove server-side plotting)
- Stateless architecture (bundled signal data)
- Enhanced EMG analysis integration
- Improved frontend chart capabilities

## Latest Update: Authentication System Complete ‚úÖ (July 30, 2025)
**Status**: PRODUCTION READY - Complete authentication system with perfect UX
**Final Achievement**:

**Critical Data Flow Patterns**: 
1. **Dynamic Thresholds**: `sessionParams.session_duration_thresholds_per_muscle` ‚Üí averaged ‚Üí displayed as "‚â•{avg}s"
2. **Game Metadata**: `analysisResult.metadata.{score,level}` ‚Üí props chain ‚Üí Settings display (no Zustand dependency)
