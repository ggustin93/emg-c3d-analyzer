> what is the KISS, DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, SSoT compliant option ?

⏺ Looking at this from the perspective of core software engineering principles:

  KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

  Simplest solution: Remove /api prefix from the 4 backend routes that have it.
  - Only 4 lines to change vs 8+ lines
  - No frontend changes needed
  - Proxy rewrite stays as is

  DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

  Avoid repetition: Keep the proxy rewrite rule that strips /api once, rather than
  updating dozens of frontend service calls.
  - Single rewrite rule vs updating multiple frontend files
  - Centralized transformation logic

  SOLID - Single Responsibility

  Each layer has one job:
  - Frontend: Always uses /api/* pattern (consistent contract)
  - Proxy: Strips /api prefix (single transformation responsibility)
  - Backend: Serves routes without /api prefix (clean REST endpoints)

  YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

  Don't over-engineer: The backend doesn't actually need /api prefix.
  - Backend is already deployed and working without /api on most routes
  - Don't add complexity that isn't needed
  - The /api prefix in 4 routes was probably added by mistake

  SSoT (Single Source of Truth)

  Backend defines the API structure: Backend routes should be consistent.
  - Currently mixed (4 with /api, 8 without) - this violates SSoT
  - Should be ALL with or ALL without
  - Since majority (8 routes) don't have /api, that's the truth

  The Principle-Compliant Solution:

  Remove /api prefix from the 4 backend routes that have it:

  # Change these 4 lines:
  router = APIRouter(prefix="/clinical-notes", tags=["clinical-notes"])  # was 
  "/api/clinical-notes"
  router = APIRouter(prefix="/therapists", tags=["therapists"])          # was 
  "/api/therapists"
  router = APIRouter(prefix="/logs", tags=["logs"])                      # was "/api/logs"
  router = APIRouter(prefix="/cache", tags=["Cache"])                    # was 
  "/api/cache"

  This solution:
  - ✅ KISS: Minimal changes (4 lines)
  - ✅ DRY: Proxy handles all /api stripping
  - ✅ SOLID: Each layer has single responsibility
  - ✅ YAGNI: Don't add /api where not needed
  - ✅ SSoT: Backend consistently has NO /api prefix

  Why NOT add /api to all backend routes?
  - Would require changing 8+ routes instead of 4
  - Would require removing proxy rewrite
  - Adds unnecessary path segment when backend doesn't need it
  - More complex = violates KISS

  The principle-compliant choice is clear: Remove /api from the 4 routes that have it.

⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Implementation Plan: Remove /api Prefix from 4 Backend Routes

     The KISS/SOLID/SSoT Compliant Solution

     Backend Changes (4 files):
     1. clinical_notes.py: Remove /api prefix from router
     2. therapist_resolution.py: Remove /api prefix from router
     3. logs.py: Remove /api prefix from router
     4. cache_monitoring.py: Remove /api prefix from router

     Frontend Change (1 file):
     5. clinicalNotesService.ts: Update BASE_PATH to use /clinical-notes instead of 
     /api/clinical-notes

     Why This is the Correct Solution:

     ✅ KISS: Only 5 lines to change (minimal)
     ✅ DRY: Proxy handles all /api stripping in one place
     ✅ SOLID: Each layer has single responsibility
     ✅ YAGNI: Don't add /api where not needed
     ✅ SSoT: Backend becomes consistent - NO /api prefix anywhere

     Implementation Steps:

     1. Remove /api prefix from 4 backend route definitions
     2. Update clinicalNotesService.ts BASE_PATH
     3. Test all endpoints work correctly

     This creates a clean, consistent architecture where:
     - Frontend always uses /api/* pattern
     - Proxy strips /api for all requests
     - Backend serves all routes without /api prefix
