# Clinical Notes Feature - Implementation Plan

**Feature**: Clinical Notes System for EMG C3D Analyzer
**Branch**: `feature/clinical-notes`
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Created**: 2025-09-05
**Completed**: 2025-09-07

## Overview

Implementing a clinical note-taking system that allows researchers and therapists to document observations linked to C3D files and patients. The system will be private (each user sees only their own notes) and support markdown formatting.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create feature branch
- [x] Create database migration for clinical_notes table
- [x] Implement RLS policies for note privacy
- [x] Create ClinicalNotesService with repository pattern
- [x] Add API endpoints with proper validation
- [x] Write backend unit tests (API, service, and RLS tests)

### Phase 2: Frontend Core ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for notes
- [x] Implement useClinicalNotes custom hook
- [x] Build ClinicalNotesModal component
- [x] Create MarkdownEditor component
- [x] Add ClinicalNotesBadge components

### Phase 3: Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add notes integration to C3DFileList
- [x] Connect frontend to backend API
- [x] Implement batch loading for performance
- [x] Add loading states and error handling
- [x] Fixed API configuration issues

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Write frontend component tests
- [x] Add integration tests for workflows
- [x] Performance optimization (concurrent navigation)
- [x] UI/UX polish and accessibility
- [x] Production RLS testing script

## Technical Decisions

1. **Database Design**: Single table with flexible targeting (file OR patient)
2. **Security**: Row-Level Security ensuring complete privacy
3. **Frontend State**: Using Zustand for notes state management
4. **Editor**: Simple markdown with minimal toolbar for non-technical users
5. **Performance**: Batch loading of note indicators for file list

## Dependencies

- Supabase RLS system (existing)
- Authentication flow (existing)
- React-markdown library (to be added)
- Shadcn UI components (existing)

## Success Criteria ✅ ALL ACHIEVED

- [x] Users can create/edit/delete notes for files
- [x] Users can create/edit/delete notes for patients
- [x] Notes support markdown formatting
- [x] Complete privacy (RLS enforced)
- [x] Performance: <200ms modal open time with concurrent navigation
- [x] Intuitive UX that doesn't disrupt workflow

## Next Steps

1. Create database migration
2. Start backend service implementation
3. Begin with API endpoints
